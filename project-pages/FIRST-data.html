            <h2>Challenge</h2>
            <p>In high school, I was on a robotics team. Every year we built a robot to compete against 3500+ teams
                nationally, in competitions organized by a nonprofit called FIRST. I was also involved local social
                justice work, which made me curious: <b>How is a team's performance affected by its economic
                    situation?</b></p>
        </section>

        <section class="project-section">
            <h2>Solution Summary</h2>
            <p>To explore the question quantitatively, I had to collect data, conduct a statistical analysis, and
                visualize the results.
        </section>

        <section class="project-section">
            <h2>Collecting Data</h2>
            <p>First, I measured team performance based on points scored or matches won, but the data was too noisy to
                be useful.</p>
            <p>Looking for something else, I collected data for which teams qualified for the world championship by
                coding a program that navigates the FIRST website, like a person would, and scrapes the list of
                qualifying teams off of it and their zip code. </p>
            <p>To measure a team's economic situation I looked at percent free and reduced lunches (no data for private
                schools!), team budgets (no data at all!), and finally Census income data for each team's school's zip
                code. </p>

        <section class="project-section">
            <h2>Statistical Analysis</h2>
            <p>Finally, after taking a Yale data analysis class, I, and two partners, executed a more thorough
                statistical analysis of demographic information in FIRST. This time I queried the FIRST API for the
                data. Some highlights are shown below, and the full report is linked <a
