            <h2>Challenge</h2>
            <p>In summer 2023, I worked with my math professor, Vidvuds Ozolins, chair of Yale applied physics, on a
                major problem in quantum computing -- quantum error correction. The information storing qubits in a
                quantum computer often randomly corrupt mid-computation making large programs infeasible.</p>
            <p>One solution is storing information on a hyberbolic lattice, which enables use of topological properties
                that endure the corruption of a single qubit. Understanding such a system requires calculating its
                energy band structure, which is what I worked on. </p>
        </section>

        <section class="project-section">
            <h2>Solution Summary</h2>
            <p>The energy band structure can be approximated with the tight-binding model which simplifies the math
                involved be assuming all electrons each belong to a fixed site on the lattice. Initially the goal was to
                do this computation on a hyperbolic lattice, but that goal shifted to implementing a tight-binding model
                for the more traditional Bravais lattice as proof-of-concept because I wanted to get the model right
                before extrapolating to the more novel situation.</p>
            <p>Shown below is code for the model I wrote. The cube of spheres pictured above is a visualization I made
                of a simple cubic Bravais lattice.</p>

            <h2>Result</h2>
            <p>My program takes as input 3 binding parameters which represent the interactions between atoms in the
                lattice. It produces a visualization of the electronic band structure, that's manipulable and updates in
                real time as a user adjusts the binding parameters. My model's advantage is this interactivity which
                facilitates analysis and develops intuition for the workings of lattice band structures.</p>
            <p>Pictured below is the program's output for various values of the binding parameters.</p>
